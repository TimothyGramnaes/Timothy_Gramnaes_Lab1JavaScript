        </br>
        The stranger stretches you his hand and helps you get back on your feet.
        </br>
        Once you stand up the hooded character removes his hood. Two kind eyes framed by
        a bald scalp and a salt-and-pepper bearded face looks back at you.
        </br>
        </br>
        The man starts to speak in a gentle deep barritone:

        "It pains me that you had to go through all this in order to meet me. but I had to make sure that you were in fact
        the chosen one.. So tell me traveller what is your true name? Not your earthly name but your true name?"
