        <h1>What just happened?</h1>
        <p>
            You wake up with no recollection of who you are sitting on a toilet-seat in a small filthy
            room with no windows. You are naked, you feel alone, scared and confused.
        </br>Type start to make sense of all of this.
        </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Rise up-->

        <div id="rise" class="text hidden">

            <p>
                You rise up. The foul stench of old fiecies pierces your nostrils, the dim light from a single light-bulb hanging 
                in its cable from the roof luminates a big closed door. 
            </br>would you like to "flush toilet" or "inspect the door"?
            </p>
        </div>

        <!--Door-->
        <div id="toilet-door" class="text hidden">
            <p>
                The door is hella locked. aint no way in hell that you will ever get it open. The smell from the toilet feels overwhelming now. Are you sure
                that you dont want to flush it?
            </p>
            </div>

        <!--Flush toilet-->

        <div id="flush-toilet" class="text hidden">
            <p>
                You flush the toilet. As the the water start twirling blending fecal matter with
                dirty toilet water the hypnotizing spiral seam to suck all light in to it. In fact it starts to
                drain your energy as well.. The sound of rumbling water intesifies as your 
                starts to get sucked down the filthy toilet.
            </br>
            </br>

                <p>
                    Remember thinking "Things can't possibly get any worse?"
                    What a foolish line of thought, huh?
                </br>
                After beeing flushed you slid down a almost vertical pipe and where tossed down a murky
                sewer. As you rise to your feet you se a giant Crocodile standing on two legs wearing a tiara munching away
                on a floppy taco and steadily keeps eye contact with you.
                </br>
                Do you "run away" or "say hi"?

                <p>
                    The Crocodile answers in a supprisingly high-pitched voice:
                </br>
                    "Greeting traveller! would you like to purchase some potions?"
