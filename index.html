        <h1>What just happened?</h1>
        <p>
            You wake up with no recollection of who you are sitting on a toilet-seat in a small filthy
            room with no windows. You are naked, you feel alone, scared and confused.
        </br>Type start to make sense of all of this.
        </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Rise up-->

        <div id="rise" class="text hidden">

            <p>
                You rise up. The foul stench of old fiecies pierces your nostrils, the dim light from a single light-bulb hanging 
                in its cable from the roof luminates a big closed door. 
            </br>would you like to "flush toilet" or "inspect the door"?
            </p>
        </div>

        <!--Door-->
        <div id="toilet-door" class="text hidden">
            <p>
                The door is hella locked. aint no way in hell that you will ever get it open. The smell from the toilet feels overwhelming now. Are you sure
                that you dont want to flush it?
            </p>
