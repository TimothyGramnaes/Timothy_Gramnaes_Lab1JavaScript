            You start walking down the sewer until you find yourself at a crossroad.

            From the tunnel to your left you hear a soothing choir singing lullabys.

            From the tunnel to your right you hear people muttering in a deep voice.

        </br>
        He stretches you his hand to help you get back up on your feet.
        </br>
        Once you stand up the hooded character removes his hood and two kind eyes looks back at you,
        framed by a bald scalp and salt-and-pepper bearded face.
        </br>
        </br>
        The man starts to speak in a gentle barritone:
        </br>
        "It pains me that you had to go through all this in order to meet me. but I had to make sure that you were in fact
        the chosen one.. So tell me traveller what is your true name? Not your earthly name but your true name?"
